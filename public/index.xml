      <description>Now trying RMarkdown in Clement. I should still have MathJax (\(\sigma\)). I’m just not sure why some of the css is overridden when I do blogdown::serve_site() instead of hugo serve -D.
Nope, I was wrong: Blogdown follows my css exactly. OK, now let’s try some in-line R: 2.

      <description>Measuring them lines I am going to type a few sentences to see where the lines break and how big the typeface is. Also, I&amp;rsquo;m going to see if code shows up in a different type face, and whether a
