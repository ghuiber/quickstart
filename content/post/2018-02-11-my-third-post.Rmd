Now trying RMarkdown in Clement. I should still have MathJax ($\sigma$). I'm just not sure why some of the css is overridden when I do `blogdown::serve_site()` instead of `hugo serve -D`.

Nope, I was wrong: Blogdown follows my css exactly. OK, now let's try some in-line R: `r 1+1`.

And now let's try an R block:

```{r myBlock, echo = FALSE}
plot(cars, pch = 20)
```

So, I can just start a new post with the New Post add-in in RStudio and just check the R Markdown (.Rmd) radio button and I'm good to go. It's going to be R Markdown instead of Markdown, and it will render plain html just as well as Markdown would. The advantage is that I am in familiar territory, with in-line R and R code block working as they do in R notebooks. The cost is that there's a [small speed penalty](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/output-format.html) over plain Markdown. That's fine.
