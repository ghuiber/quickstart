# Clement Theme

A minimalist theme for Hugo whose only merit is that it started as the bare minimum and grew from there. This was my attempt at understanding what a theme does; like a reverse teardown. I started with Yihui Xie's already barebones [hugo-xmin](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin) and dropped stuff from it until it didn't work anymore. Then I added stuff I thought I'd need.
